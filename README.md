This project focusses on image enhancement techniques along with a MATLAB implementation of those techniques listed as follows:

Point Processing Techniques
1. Contrast Stretching
2. Histogram Equalisation

Filtering 
3. Linear Spatial Filtering
4. Median Filtering

5. Bandpass Filtering (Suppressing Noise Interference Patterns)
 
6. Undoing Perspective Distortion of Planar Surface
